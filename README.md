Objective: To develop a robust banking transaction management system that leverages the strengths of MySQL for transactional integrity and MongoDB for flexible user management and session handling. This system aims to facilitate seamless operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries with high security and scalability. 

Project Phases Overview:  
Conceptualization and Design: Define the system architecture, design the database schemas, and model the interactions
between MySQL and MongoDB.    
Implementation: Develop the backend logic to handle banking operations, set up database connections,
implement security measures, and create a user-friendly frontend interface.  
Testing and Optimization: Perform thorough testing, including stress testing for scalability, security vulnerability
assessments, and optimization for both databases.  
Deployment and Monitoring: Deploy the system with proper monitoring tools in place to oversee performance and swiftly
address any issues.
